Drone Delivery Path Planner (C Project)

This project is a multi-file C application that simulates an optimized drone delivery routing system.  
It uses package coordinates, weight, and priority to plan delivery trips within drone capacity.

This project is developed as part of B.Tech 1st Semester – Problem Solving with C and demonstrates  
the use of structures, 2D arrays, functions, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and modular programming.
