Drone Delivery Path Planner (C Project)

A modular C-based program that simulates drone delivery routing using package
coordinates, weight limits, and priority values. The drone selects packages
based on priority → nearest, calculates distance, fuel usage, and flight time,
and generates a final delivery report.
